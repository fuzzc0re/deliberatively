# Deliberatively

This is a Solana program to create fully liquid deliberative democracy tokens.

Holders of these tokens can participate in votes. Their balance represents their voting power. With every transaction they essentially transfer a percentage of their voting power to another voter who they deem more capable of making an informed decision on the issue at hand.

The inspiration comes from the model in [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01436.pdf).

More docs to come soon.
